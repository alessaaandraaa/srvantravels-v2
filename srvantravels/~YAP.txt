I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS IDEA
Basically if you quit in the middle of a package booking

When you click Book Package, it redirects you to the package-id/booking page 
With a notification that says 
"You have an ongoing booking for a package. bla bla bla press back to start over"
And like it keeps all data for that booking

HANDLE THE EDGE CASE OF DIRECTLY JUMPING TO THE BOOKING PAGE LATER PLS ASKGBASTBABT
YEAH THIS I NEED TO MAKE A TOAST FOR THIS

NEW HANDLING:
    WHEN IN SUMMARY, CLEAR ZUSTAND SO YOU CANT GO BACK AND ALL


TO DO IMPLEMENTATIONS
- Booking Availability (COMPLEX)
- Form Global state management (warning dialog, clearing store, etc.)
- Custom itinerary time business logic
